# Sessions Directory

A session is what you would deliver in one continuous block of teaching time (either in-person or online). So, typically, it would be the same as a practical lab session or an evening's homework.

This is where you would set up your own notebooks where you've remixed content from the atoms and added your own 'gloss' on the material to prepare it for teaching. We've also provided example sessions that can also be assembled as part of a full course spanning a week (intensive), a term or a semester.
