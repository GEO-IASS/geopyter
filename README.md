# GeoPyTeR: Geographical Python Teaching Resource


## Vision
GeoPyTer is a project to support open source geospatial education using Python. 


## Structure 

The philosophy of GeoPyTeR is that the value added that a geoeducator brings to their course rests in their perspective on the topic at hand.

At the core of GeoPyTeR are *atoms* which represent thematic content on a particular geospatial topic in the form of Jupyter notebooks. The atoms form the building blocks for modules, or lectures, that can be formed through a mash-up of atoms. Modules, in turn, can be combined to compose a course. The articulation of an instructor's perspective is in the composition of specific atoms the instructor selects for a module together with the narrative that integrates the atoms to construct the lecture.
