# Foundational Concepts in Programming

This atom contains the key materials to take geography students who have never programmed before from the 'hello world' level through to their first function. We deliberately ignore some of the subtleties of Python (classes, inheritance, etc.) in favour of getting students going as quickly as possible.

## Data Sets

Ideally, examples in this atom will make use of the following data sets only:
* pysal.examples.???
* local CSV file???

## Sequencing

You are always free to import as much or as little of the atom as you need, but the intended sequence for the materials is:
