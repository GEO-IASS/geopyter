# Foundational Concepts in Programming

This atom contains the introductory materials to take geography students who have never programmed before from the 'hello world' level through to their first function. We deliberately ignore some of the subtleties of Python (classes, inheritance, etc.) in favour of getting students going as quickly as possible.

## Data Sets

Examples in this atom make use of the following data sets:
* [UK_Major_Metro_Areas.csv](./data/UK_Major_Metro_Areas.csv) (Derived from Wikipedia data) -- this file contains one header row and ten observations; it is intended to be easy to read for students so that they can understand what is going on when the read in the file. The permanent URL for this data set is: https://github.com/...
* [UK_Metro_Areas.csv](./data/UK_Metro_Areas.csv) (Derived from Wikipedia data) -- this file contains one header row and 73 observations; it is intended to demonstrate the value of computers in parsing data sets that do _not_ scan easily. The permanent URL for this data set is: https://github.com/...
* US Regional Income Data: this can be found in the pysal.examples directory under  'us_income/usjoin.csv'. Since this data is provided by default with PySAL it does not need to be downloaded from a remote URL.

## Sequencing

You are always free to import as much or as little of the atom as you need, but the intended sequence for the materials is:
