When these rules become sufficiently complex they are called algorithms. And when they get so complicated that they are not easy to write down as a set of logical outputs, it's often easier to express in a more human-readable form... which is why we have [programming languages](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/proglang.htm).\n",

And that's only because we have had a lot more practice in the language of programming. So the _only_ stupid thing you can do in this course is to assume that you can speed through the questions and don't have to practice or think through the technical aspects of the coding. There are web sites that will give you answers (in fact, we're going to point you to some of them) but if you don't expend any effort in trying to understand how the code works, or if you just copy the answer off of your friend, that's the same as assuming you'll learn a language just because your friend is taking the same language course! _That_ is silly."

Basically, people have claimed that if a computer can pass the test then we'll have to declare that machines have become AIs (Artificial Intelligences); howwever, they still seem to have a hard time fooling anyone for very long. \n",

    "In contrast, bigger and better computers have now beat us at Chess and Go, and are being used to help us understand earthquakes and climate change on a huge scale. Here, computers can do billions -- or trillions -- of calculations a second to work out that if 'A' happens then 'B' is the next most likely thing to happen, and so on and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that games like Go and Chess have well-understood rules, as do processes like climate change and (sort of) earthquakes. We may not know all of the rules yet, and even simple games can produce trillions of possible 'next moves', but people don't have the same unchanging rules. Yes, conversations have norms (unless you're using an online comment forum where it's normal to start a conversation by asking someone if they're an idiot) but people don't just play 'games' according to those rules, they actually play with the rules themselves (see: online forums) in a way that computers finds very, very hard to follow.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another useful idea comes from [Larry Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall) (strong 'tache game!), who created a programming language called Perl. Larry said that programmers had three virtues: Laziness, Hubris, and Impatience. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://cdn.quotationof.com/images/larry-wall-1.jpg\",width=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that these are virtues in programming (but not in your classes!) is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Laziness** makes you want to put in the effort _now_ to reduce the amount of effort you'll have to put in _later_. So the effort that went into inventing the calculator in the first place (and in making it easy to use) meant that lots and lots of other people never had to do this stuff by hand or using slide rules.\n",
    "2. **Hubris** makes you want to write code that other people won't want to \"say bad things about\". In the course we'll get into what makes 'good' code in more detail, but the short version is: it's efficient, it's easy to read, and it's clever.\n",
    "3. **Impatience** is about wanting the answer _now_ rather than waiting for a lazy computer. If you find yourself waiting long periods of time for something that the computer should be able to do _quickly_ then you should be impatient. Chances are, you made a mistake in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Hint: you'll also see a lot of laziness when you start trying to write code. Programmers don't like writing `remove` when they could just write `rm`, nor do they like writing `define` when they could just write `def`. Keep an eye out for these mnemonics as they can be pretty daunting at first._**"

    "### The 3 false virtues\n",
    "\n",
    "Larry also pointed out that these virtues had three mirror-image false virtues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **False laziness** happens when you leave something working but half-finished and, most likely, about to break. When you start using [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/) you may find that it makes it easy to copy&paste answers into your notebook and then you can glue it all together messily. This isn't the same as _understanding_ and _adapting_ the solution that you found online to _your_ problem, so it's false laziness. To develop a learning mindset, [don't copy&paste code, type it out](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-benefits-of-typing-instead-of-copying-54ed734ad849#.es5mw1j0z). \n",
    "2. **False hubris** is thinking that no one else's code is 'good enough' for you. Sometimes copy&paste is false laziness, but refusing to recognise when copy&paste (or importing a library, more on this later) _is_ the right thing to do is false hubris.\n",
    "3. **False impatience** is getting started on solving a problem when you don't yet understand what the problem _is_. One thing that a lot of programmers do is half-listen to what someone has asked them to do and then go haring off without sitting down to make any kind of plan or structure. It's like writing an essay without having done the readings.\n",

    "## The Benefits of Coding?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a research context we think that the benefits of learning to code fall into three categories:\n",
    "1. **Flexibility**: the computer can often apply the same analytical process to completely different data sets (_e.g._ rainfall in UK vs rainfall in the US) with minimal effort compared to trying to do each step in, say, Excel or SPSS. For students it comes down to this: if you discover a newer, better data set half way through your dissertation and want to use this for your analysis instead of the old, inaccurate data, it's a lot easier and faster to update your analyses if you have used code!\n",
    "2. **Reproducibility**: recently, it's been discovered that a lot of research cannot be reproduced. In other words, if one scientist tries to duplicate what someone else did in order to check something out (as is important in the scientific method) they're finding that the results don't line up. So a second example of why coding your data analysis for a dissertation: you've just finished your analysis when someone points out that you made a mistake with the data right back at the beginning; redoing all of that in Excel or SPSS would be a nightmare, but with code it can be as easy as changing one line and hitting 'Run'!\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: a computer doesn't care if you throw 10 lines or 10 billion lines at it, the only thing that changes is how long it takes to get an answer. In other words, if your code 'works' on a proper subset of your data it will also work on your entire data set no matter how big it is."

There's [much debate about the relative merits of Python vs R](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-for-data-analysis-R-or-Python), and both Python and R can help us to undertake geographical analysis. That is, in fact, the premise of this entire course! \n",
    "\n",
    "So why have we chosen to use Python here? Of the two languages, we think that Python has some specific advantages:\n",
    "1. It was designed for teaching, so its syntax is easier for a human to 'parse' than R's\n",
    "2. It is more _like_ other languages, so its more readily transferrable if you need to learn another language. Think of it as learning Italian, which also makes it easier to learn Spanish and French.\n",
    "3. It is the one most-used as part of a _geographical workflow_ â€“ what we mean by this is that you can find Python buried inside of ESRI's ArcGIS and the open-source QGIS applications, and it also sits behind (or talks to) a number of other tools that allow us to work flexibly and scalably with geo-data. \n",
    "4. Is is easier to operationalise â€“Â Python offers more services/tools to enable you to turn something from a 'hack' ([which doesn't mean what you think it means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacks_at_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology) into a 'service'.\n",
    "However, if you have been told R is the way to go then don't worry, the concepts covered here still translate. And many of the contributors to GeoPyTer use both languages... it just depends on the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, we are using Python version 2.7, although you can also download a version 3. We're sticking with the older version for the time being because there are more (geo) tools available to us in Python 2 than Python 3. This is changing quickly, but for now it's the safest decision. So if at any point you are asked to choose between Python versions, make sure you pick 2.X (there will be a 2.8 and 2.9 eventually)."
